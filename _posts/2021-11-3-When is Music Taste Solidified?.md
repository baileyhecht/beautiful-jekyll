Back in 2018, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz published his report on what age are you when your taste in music solidifies, using user data from Spotify. In particular he collected data on what year the user was born, their gender, their most listen to songs, and their most listened to genres. Stephens-Davidowitz reports seeing a consistent correlation between user’s most frequently played songs, their gender, and their age when it came out. The example he gives in the article is that most men who like “Creep” by Radiohead were 38 years old at the time of the study meaning they were 14 when the song first came out. Stephens-Davidowitz reports seeing a similar correlation for women with songs that came out when they were 13 years old. He argues that the data shows that peak
influence on adult musical preferences is at 13 for girls and 14 for boys. He also found that these childhood influences are stronger for women than they are for men. 

For this data set the null hypothesis would be that there is no correlation between age and when taste in music is cemented and Stephens-Davidowitz’s alternative hypothesis is that there is in fact a correlation between the two. All of his data was collected by Spotify and was not specifically funded by any group. These data sets however are not public so it is not easily replicable without getting the data from Spotify. Stephens-Davidowitz claimed to be interested in this data to settle a debate between him and his brother, a very valid reason if you ask me. I don’t think publish or perish had much of an effect on this study as much as genuine interest did. Unlike other analysis, this one is interesting not just to a small community of researchers but also a more general public. 

While the data shared in the graphs seems to line up with his thesis indicating a peak age, we cannot be sure without consulting his original dataset. I do still have a few issues with his analysis. First, how exactly did he come to these conclusions. His written description of using the song “Creep” seems to contradict the methods he claims to use in the more general graphs. There a few graphs that support the individual song way recording the data, but in that case what specific songs did he choose and why? My other main complaint is his assumption that music taste is static. As someone who has gone through many music phases spanning show tunes to screamo, I find it hard to believe that most people solidify their taste. While I am skeptical of his analysis, I still find it mostly trustworthy and it contains an interesting enough argument to warrant more research into the topic.
